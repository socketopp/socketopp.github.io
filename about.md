## Hi there!

## About me

### TLDR; 
Versatile, tech-savvy and curious coder that have a natural passion for problem solving and programming. I like to work with modern technologies and learn new things.
I usually work in Python, Javascript, Java and C++. I have an eye for design but enjoy backend in the long run. Currently situated in Stockholm where I work as backend developer @ Bambuser.

### Long story

My name is Sokrates and I am a developer based in Stockholm. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science & Programming and a BA in Cognitive Science from [Link√∂ping University](https://liu.se/). 
I work as a software developer where I code in Java but also many in-house languages. I have a keen interest in linguistics, artificial intelligence and other interdiciplinary fields of Cognitive Science. On my free time, I like to exercise, travel and play [Squad](https://joinsquad.com/). 

I started programming back in 2014 when I was studying Cognitive Science. I found the technical side of CogSci to be very facinating, however, I felt rather limited by my programming expertise and thereon I pursued a BS in Computer Science and programming. Upon starting to learn programming, I discovered an entire field that I was interested in, everything from web technologies, systems programming, networks, information theory, learning systems and video games etc. Lately, I have sort of side tracked from my initial interest in CogSci but I have some side projects that I would love to pick up soon. 

## Projects
I pick up new languages with ease. I get around mainly in Javscript, C++, Python and Java. During my final year in University I wrote a static analyzer [FlakyHoover](https://github.com/socketopp/flakyhoover) that detect test smells that could induce flaky tests. I recently implemented a voice assistant that change my computer's playback device (from headset to speakers and vice versa). Check it out [Playback-assistant](https://github.com/socketopp/playback-assistant).
My latest project [divergent](https://github.com/socketopp/divergent) is a tool that run a test until it both fails and passes and then provide the user where the test execution lines and return values diverged. 

### Q&A 

- *Are you named after the footballer or philosopher?* 

Good question. Neither, my parents decided to pick one name each; one Swedish and one Greek name.

- *What's Socketopp?*

Socketopp is a pun based on my nickname Socke, short for Sokrates. Socke*r*topp is sugarloaf (refined sugar in a cone).
