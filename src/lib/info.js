I'm ${firstName}, a fullstack developer based in Sweden with a passion for building useful things.
By day, I work with Ruby on Rails and MobX, crafting robust web applications. By night, you'll find me tinkering on side projects and exploring new technologies.
Currently diving deep into Svelte and loving every bit of it. I'm a big advocate for open source and enjoy learning new things that push the boundaries of what's possible.`;
